# Exchange Server Registration Manual
1.  On Exchange Server we assume that the application ID is `00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000`. No registration is required.\
2.  When the [OutlookIntegration Installation](<OutlookIntegration Installation and Registration Manual.md>) talks about the **Entra Application ID**, just use this GUID.

# Add-in installation
1.  Open the [**Exchange Admin Center**](https://localhost/ecp/) (typically directly on the Exchange Server).
2.  Navigate to **organization** → **add-ins**

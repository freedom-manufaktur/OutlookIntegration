# 1. Acquire a certificate
You should acquire a valid TLS certificate for public internet access.

> OutlookIntegration supports internet enabled devices, like iOS or Android phone. Intranet or self-signed certificates only provide a limited functionality.

The acquired certificate should be available in the *Manage computer certificates* management console.

# 2. Set permissions
> OutlookIntegration uses a [minimum privileges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localservice-account) account, which - by default - does not have access to private keys.

1. Right click the certificate, select **All Tasks** → **Manage Private Keys...**.
2. Add the user **LOCAL SERVICE** and allow **Read** access.

# 3. Configure application settings
Navigate to the directory \
`%ProgramData%\freedom manufaktur\OutlookIntegration` \
This directory contains the configuration for the app `appsettings.json` as well as some other app files.
Editing `appsettings.json` will show something like:
```
{
  "Urls": "http://localhost:8000",
  "[Example]Kestrel": {
    "Certificates": {
      "Default": {
        "$Help.Subject": "Subject without 'CN='. E.g. localhost",
        "Subject": "localhost",
        "$Help.Store": "My | Root |..., See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.storename?view=net-10.0",
        "Store": "My",
        "$Help.Location": "CurrentUser | LocalMachine",
        "Location": "LocalMachine",
        "$Help.AllowInvalid": "Allow invalid certificates? E.g. self-signed",
        "AllowInvalid": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
You should edit the sections `Urls` and `Kestrel:Certificates`.

> Your `Kestrel` section may be named `[Example]Kestrel`, which is an example that has no effect. Remove the `[Example]` tag to enable the section.

In our example, we would end up with the following settings:
```
{
  "Urls": "https://addin.MyCompany.com:443;https://localhost:443",
  "Kestrel": {
    "Certificates": {
      "Default": {
        "Subject": "MyCompany.com",
        "Store": "My",
        "Location": "LocalMachine",
        "AllowInvalid": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> There are other ways to configure HTTPS, e.g. through `.pfx`, `.pem` or `.crt` files. Learn more about those methods [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints?view=aspnetcore-10.0#configure-https-in-appsettingsjson).

# 4. Restart Microservice
After any modifications to `appsettings.json`, you need to restart the OutlookIntegration service for the changes to take effect.

Test the changes by visiting https://addin.MyCompany.com
You should be greeted with a welcome message.
